This repository provides the anonymized versions of the discussion threads from the forums of 60 Coursera Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs), for a total of about 100,000 threads. This dataset is associated to the paper:

The dataset has been anonymized as follows: the text and the names of the authors of all the posts and comments have been removed. The author indentifiers have been re-encoded so not to much the Coursera indentifiers.
